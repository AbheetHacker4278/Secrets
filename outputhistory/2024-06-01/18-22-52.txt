Transgender Security Checks
Purpose: To ensure the safety of all passengers while respecting the privacy and dignity of transgender individuals.
Procedure:
1. Identification Verification

Transgender passengers may present the following forms of identification:
Current passport with updated gender marker
Birth certificate or amendment reflecting gender identity
Driver's license or state ID with updated gender marker
Court order or legal document recognizing gender identity



2. Screening

Body Scanners:
Transgender passengers may opt for a full-body scan or a pat-down.
Passengers who have undergone gender-affirming surgery may choose to be scanned in the gender they identify with, regardless of their anatomical sex.


Metal Detectors:
Transgender passengers may be asked to remove certain articles of clothing or accessories that interfere with the metal detector.
Passengers may request a private screening room if they feel uncomfortable being screened in a public area.



3. Pat-Downs

If a full-body scan is not possible or not preferred, transgender passengers may undergo a pat-down.
The pat-down will be conducted by a security officer of the same gender as the passenger, whenever possible.
The security officer will respect the passenger's privacy and avoid touching sensitive areas.

4. Additional Considerations

Transgender passengers may request a companion or advocate to be present during the screening process.
Passengers may ask to speak with a supervisor or manager if they have any concerns or complaints about the screening process.
Security officers are trained to be sensitive and respectful of transgender individuals.

Inform the security officer of your transgender status and any specific preferences you have.
Be clear about your preferred gender identity and pronouns.
Feel empowered to ask questions or request assistance if needed.
Remember that you have the right to be treated with respect and dignity.
