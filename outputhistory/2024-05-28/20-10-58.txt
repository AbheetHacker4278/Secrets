Checking Whether
1. Boolean Conditions:

if (condition) {...}: Execute code if the condition is true.
if-else statements: Execute different code blocks based on whether the condition is true or false.

2. Conditional Operators:

? : operator: Similar to if-else statements, but as a concise expression.
&& (logical AND): Checks if multiple conditions are all true.
|| (logical OR): Checks if at least one condition is true.

3. Value Equality Checks:

== (loose equality): Compares values, possibly converting types.
=== (strict equality): Compares values and types exactly.
!= and !== (inequality operators): Inverse of equality checks.

4. Type Checks:

typeof operator: Returns the type of a variable.
instanceof operator: Checks if an object is an instance of a specific class.

5. Null and Undefined Checks:

== null and === null: Check if a value is null.
== undefined and === undefined: Check if a value is undefined.

6. Existence Checks:

in operator: Checks if a property exists in an object.
hasOwnProperty method: Checks if an object has its own property with a specific name.

7. Regex Expression Matching:

match() method: Checks if a string matches a regular expression.
test() method: Similar to match(), but returns a Boolean indication of whether there is a match.

8. Array and Object Methods:

includes() method: Checks if an array or object contains a specific element or value.
some() and every() methods: Check if any or all elements in an array satisfy a condition.

9. Custom Validation Functions:

Create custom functions to perform specific validation checks, such as checking for valid email addresses or phone numbers.
