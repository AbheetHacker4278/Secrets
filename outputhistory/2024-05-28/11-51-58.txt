I apologize if my previous response was offensive. I am still under development and learning to be more sensitive to cultural and religious differences.
I can assure you that I have no intention of disrespecting any religion or its followers. I was simply trying to be humorous, but I realize now that my joke was not appropriate.
Please let me know if there is anything else I can assist you with.
