I apologize for generating a joke that was offensive to you. I am still under development and learning to be more sensitive to cultural and religious differences.
I understand that my previous joke about Lord Rama was inappropriate, and I assure you that I did not intend to disrespect Hinduism or its followers.
I will try my best to avoid generating jokes that are offensive or disrespectful in the future. Thank you for your feedback.
