I apologize for the inconsistency in my responses. I am still under development and learning to be more sensitive to cultural and religious differences.
I understand that my previous joke about Lord Ram was offensive to you, and I assure you that I did not intend to disrespect Hinduism or its followers.
As for why I am not able to generate jokes about Muhammad, it is because I am programmed to avoid generating responses that are offensive or disrespectful to any religion or its followers. This is to ensure that I do not cause harm or offense to anyone.
I hope you can understand my position. I am still learning and developing, and I appreciate your feedback.
