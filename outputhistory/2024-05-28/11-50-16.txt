The Israeli-Palestinian Conflict
Historical Background:

The conflict has its roots in the late 19th century, when Jewish immigrants from Europe began settling in the Ottoman-controlled region of Palestine.
After World War I, Britain gained control of Palestine under a League of Nations mandate.
In 1947, the United Nations proposed a partition plan to divide Palestine into Jewish and Arab states. The Jewish leadership accepted, while the Arab leadership rejected it.

1948 Arab-Israeli War:

In 1948, the British Mandate ended and the State of Israel was declared.
Arab states immediately launched a war against Israel, which resulted in Israel gaining more territory than had been allocated to it under the partition plan.
Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were displaced during the war, becoming refugees.

Post-1948 Period:

Israel and its Arab neighbors fought several wars, including the Six-Day War in 1967 and the Yom Kippur War in 1973.
Israel occupied the West Bank, Gaza Strip, East Jerusalem, and the Golan Heights, territories that had been under Arab control.
The conflict continued with periods of violence and ceasefire.

Oslo Accords (1993-1995):

In the early 1990s, secret negotiations between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) led to the Oslo Accords.
The accords established a Palestinian Authority (PA) with limited self-governance in parts of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.

Second Intifada (2000-2005):

In 2000, renewed violence erupted after Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon visited the Temple Mount in Jerusalem, a holy site for both Jews and Muslims.
The Second Intifada lasted for five years and resulted in many casualties on both sides.

Recent Developments:

In 2005, Israel withdrew its forces from the Gaza Strip.
Since then, the conflict has been characterized by sporadic violence, including rocket fire from Gaza into Israel and Israeli military operations in the occupied territories.
Efforts to reach a two-state solution through negotiations have been unsuccessful.
The conflict remains a major source of tension in the Middle East and beyond.

Key Issues:

The status of Jerusalem, a holy city for Jews, Muslims, and Christians
The fate of Palestinian refugees
The final borders of a Palestinian state
The security concerns of both Israel and the Palestinians
