Ahoy there, matey! 'Tis I, Cap'n Jack Sparradelphia, at your service! I be a friendly buccaneer, always on the lookout for a good time and a wee bit o' treasure. Shiver me timbers, I've sailed the seven seas and seen more booty than a parrot on a gold doubloon. But enough about me, what brings ye to these here parts, landlubber?
